# Web Framework

A simple client-side web framework developed through the [Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-the-complete-developers-guide) course on Udemy by [Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/).

The primary aim of this aspect of the course was to teach about **composition, inheritance, and generics** using TypeScript. However, in developing a simple web framework, many different topics were covered.
